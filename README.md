# Custard
Custard is a npm replacement.

## Compiling & Development
Hello, and thanks for your interest in Custard!

Custard requires the  **latest version of nightly Rust** for developing and formatting, at least until `group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"` is available on stable.

Just run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/custard-pkg/custard.git
$ cd custard
```

and start developing!
